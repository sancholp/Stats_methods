## Instructions to Assignment 1A

### Ep. 1: 3-card poker

Write code that simulates randomly being dealt 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards. Determine whether the hand drawn is a straight, flush or a straight flush (or none of the above).

Simulate large number of hands and calculate probability of getting any of the three hands given above.

See what happens when the player is dealt the last 3 cards of the deck. 

### Ep. 2: Distributions of discrete measurements

Use X-ray data to classify sample of X-ray sources as black holes or neutron stars. Number of black holes is binomially distributed. Consider 2 situations:

1. Sample size of 10
2. Random sample size following Poisson distribution

Simulate $10^6$ samples of measurements for both situations, plotting the PMF of the measurements. 

Explain why the PMF in the second case follows a Poisson distribution with $\lambda=7$.
